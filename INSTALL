INSTALL


### Prerequisites

- Python 2.6.5 or higher (tested from this, could work with previous version) 
- liborient [by dam2k](https://github.com/dam2k/liborient)

### Building and Installing
	
tar pyorient-*.tar.gz
cd pyorient-*
[optionally] edit config.cfg if you've installed liborient in a non standard path 
python setup.py build
sudo python setup.py install

#### Linux

If you install liborient to a location other than the default (/usr/local) on Linux, you may need to do one of the following:

- Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the lib directory of liborient.
- Build the extension using the --rpath flag:   

python setup.py build_ext --rpath=/opt/lib
